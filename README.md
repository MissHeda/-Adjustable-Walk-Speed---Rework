# Adjustable Walk Speed - Rework
<p align="center">
    This mod allows you to change the animation speed for any animation (including custom ones)
    in Arma 3. While being mainly made as a rework for adjusting the walking speed it now provides
    you with the functionality to whitelist any animation you want and set its speed.
    It works with and without ACE 3.
